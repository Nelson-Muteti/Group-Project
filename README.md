## PROBLEM STATEMENT

<img src="https://www.onlinecybercafe.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ntsa-e1597406071817.png">


* With increasing population and motorization, Kenya as well as other African countries are faced with

  a huge problem with tragic road traffic accidents (RTA)

* This group project looks at  two sets of data (2011,2017) downloaded from Open Data Kenya website, 

 to identify trends, review progress and make recommndations based on the traffic accidents in the country.

* While acquring data was a huge challenge for the group, we had to work with the data samples available

 to make insights and recommendations.

* This project found that injuries in vulnerable road users: pedestrians, pillion passengers and motorcyclist, had seen a steady increment from 

 2011 as compared to 2017 data. 

* However, some Counties,ie. Samburu county had seen a drastic decrease in number of traffic incidences.

 While the reasons for that decrease may vary as Samburu county is a rural county, we identified areas that 

 may have contributed to this decrease.

* More insights are covered in the group Data Report including the effect of expansion of Thika Super Highway on

 accident trends in Kiambu County.

* The project recommends fine-tuning of data collection, capturing details of accident that will be useful in modeling 

  and data analysis for future planning.

* This project details  how we approached this problem and came up with insights and 
 
 a basis for  recommendations we later made. 

* The project goes from Data Loading, Data Cleaning and understanding while exclusion and inclusion procedures are 

  outlined. We used the CRISP DM Methodology to approach the project.

* The CRISP DM methodology helps break down the problem statement  into bits which are then 

  relatively easier to approach.

## Data Used

* The data used over the course of this project is provided by Open Data Kenya and can be accessed

 from our project documentation.

* There are 2 datasets, one of which is a 2011  dataset on traffic incidences

 while the other is a 2017 dataset consisting of traffic incidences recorded over the year. 

## Technologies Used

* We Used Google Colab as our primary work environment. We also used a project tracker to

 keep track of the group project tasks.
 
* We found both Google colab and the project tracker to be great tools to implement the Data Science project since they were
   
  easier to collaborate amongst group members and also link with resources and platforms such as GITHUB.
